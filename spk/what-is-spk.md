# SPK Network
The SPK Network is decentralized and incentivized network infrastructure, offering peer-to-peer storage of user content on the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). 

For the first time, users on HIVE can store encrypted files on IPFS, and pay for pinning with resource credits generated by their BROCA Power. 

There is also the LARYNX mining token, and SPK community token. 

These tokens work together to support an ecosystem of services beyond storage, including video encoding nodes, relay servers, and any other services operators want to offer on the network. 

Finally, there is an alternative to centralized web service marketplaces. 

Welcome to the SPK Network.
