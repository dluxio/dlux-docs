# DLUX Contributing Guide

Hi! We're really excited that you are interested in contributing to DLUX. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `main`, and merge back against that branch.

- If adding a new feature:

  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:

  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub can automatically squash them before merging.

- Commit messages must follow the [commit message convention](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/blob/main/.github/commit-convention.md) so that changelogs can be automatically generated.
