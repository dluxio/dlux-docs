#### Market Overview and Chart

![Current Information](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/disregardfiat/23tGTqrFpfXHKpDfETrpenwdw1kRAZLEienYk754LuvNQTMLYHF7GE62g87uR5q2sLTXC.png)
Click the HIVE or HBD Market Selector to see current conditions of that DEX. The '6h' dropdown menu will select bar widths on the chart from 1 minute to 1 day. The Bid/Ask/Last/24 hour volume is only for the Hive or HBD market as selected. The Token price is also calculated based on this last quote in the selected market.

![More Information](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/disregardfiat/23tGTqrvPyUXfXphHhnKtWQP65iKF1ti4rqrDeChSSoUvQC3LzDSomi1KAruuqm914p5v.png)
The Token Supply, Market Cap (Based on the Hive or HBD last price), DEX Fee (set by node operators), and the estimated clearing time of Hive Transactions in the multi-sig wallet are here. 10 minutes is expected because the DEX has to sign, and pass around signatures, then collect and verify those signature, then broadcast the transactions. Canceling Orders, and getting paid for your token sales both take about this long.

![Open Orders](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/disregardfiat/23tkdkb6QDbv2suDub6rDDKFd22R3XZQNwWMj54axiWyfBvX2YtE8Hm9o5RGHsGXh9Yez.png)
If you have any open orders you'll be able to see the status in this menu, as well as cancel these orders. The Token / Hive or HBD balance shown are remaining to be filled and will only be the original values if it's 0% filled.
