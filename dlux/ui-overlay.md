# UI Overlay
The dlux `UI Overlay` is built with `bootstrap 4` ([Get Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/))

The XR scene, or any other type of HTML5 `canvas` experience you build, has a layer above it called the `UI Overlay`.

This overlay has all the same blockchain functionality as the XR layer, and can be treated as a menu, in game game, or any other use case you can dream up.

You can even use the UI Overlay without an XR canvas.
