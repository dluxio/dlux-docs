# The 3D world of dlux is built using WebXR

We consider WebXR to be based on THREE.js including:

- A-Frame, an HTML implementation of WebVR
- AR.js, marker-based AR for A-Frame
- WebXR-Polyfill, markerless AR built on WebVR

In the future, the **WebXR Device API** ([Source](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr)) will be available to integrate ARKit and ARCore with WebVR, but it's not yet ready.

Use assets like 3D glTF models, images, video streams, audio files, and anything else you can image. Extend what's possible by coding components with standard web languages like JavaScript.

With WebXR, anything you can imagine, you can build.
